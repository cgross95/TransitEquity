# Transit Equity Analysis in Baltimore

This is the repository for the project by the Transit Equity team at [Data Science for Democracy 2022](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/event/ams-data-science-for-democracy/). The code here can be used to reproduce the analysis presented on the [website representing the final product](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a25710230e0a428dbe8dc3c1d9049f84).

## Where to start

The `docs` directory contains a [step-by-step listing](docs/README.md) of all documentation and associated source code. Since most of the code was written in Jupyter notebooks and Rmarkdown, this is really the same thing as the `src` directory, just in a more convenient to read format.
